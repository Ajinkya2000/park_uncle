## Project: Uncle Park (Team - Appsilium)
**Description**: Uncle Park aims to solve the problem of parking in the modern days. Due to lack of sufficient amount of proper parking places and the fear of getting their cars/bikes towed the owner park their vehicles at places, which sometimes cause traffic jam (due to narrowing of the road, as the vehicle takes half the space), sometimes this also causes harm and someone rouge might intentionally cause damage to the vehicle.

**Solution**: Consider that a person (Mr. A) has some place in his veranda or gallery.
